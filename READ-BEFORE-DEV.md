this laravel use


version:

php : PHP 7.4.33
composer : 2.1.4

please do note that some higher version of composer (example composer version > 2.2.*) has some error for the package in installement for example breeze and will not work.

please install composer version <= 2.2.*. Yes in the website say version higher can work with php7.4. But it does not work.
